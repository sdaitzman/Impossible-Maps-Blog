This week, I'm very excited to hear what other Impossible Maps students are considering working on for the project portion of the class.

# Readings

- [Feminist Data Visualization](https://civic.mit.edu/2015/12/01/feminist-data-visualization/)
    - I'm pretty sure this was assigned reading for something else I did, maybe the class I took at the Civic Media Center
    - I love the eye/body analogy near the beginning
    - I appreciate that this reading focuses on practical steps we can take as engineers/designers
- [Mapping's Intelligent Agents](https://placesjournal.org/article/mappings-intelligent-agents/)
    - The first section was a great overview of RNN/CNN self-driving models
    - I wish the second half of this were more specific about the differences it emphasizes between, for example, city planning and algorithmic distribution/optimization
- [Sisters Unchained (responses)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kh16SNPab6fCaqfMLCFKhCyQPqJ2V0lP6kwF69GOv8k/edit)
    - I'm really glad we got these responses
    - I'm struck by how the responses alternate between openly emotional/vulnerable and specific/practical
- [Balloon Mapping](https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-of-local-invasive-species-and-town-mapping)
    - RGB/Infrared cameras capture imagery from the ground
    - A kite seems to help maneuver the camera platform around
    - Photos can be cross-referenced with existing software map data

# Themes I Love

- Counter-mapping, especially the radically positive counter-maps I've looked at like Queering the Map (which is actually suffering under its own popularity right now, and having a hard time paying for hosting)
- Alternative/augmented/multi-sensory experiences that defamiliarize space
- Contemporary creative work that draws on much older theory (last night and this morning, I read all of *The Ethics of Ambiguity* by Simone de Beauvoir after it was recommended to me, along with more of *Simulations and Simulacra* because I really enjoyed the excerpt we read a few weeks ago)

# Project Ideas

In the sensory mapping space, I'm probably most interested in experimenting with sound and place. Honestly, I don't have a lot of specific project ideas yet, but I'm looking out for any ideas that other Impossible Maps students bring up and I'll continue looking for inspiration in our readings.
