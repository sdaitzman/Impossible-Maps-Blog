# Why I Signed Up for Impossible Maps

- I spent five years relying on the [MBTA](https://www.yelp.com/biz/massachusetts-bay-transportation-authority-boston), so I have strong feelings about planning and cities and maps.
- I'm not as good as I want to be at visualizing data, especially complicated data about the world that won't fit onto a graph or into a table.
- I love the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
- I spend a lot of time thinking about maps, but I've never studied them in any intentional way.

# Meta-post: Tooling, Blogs, and Editing

I'm hosting this blog using GitHub pages. I forked the ["Jekyll Now" starter pack](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), and I'm happy with the default setup for now. When I have time, I'll update the sections I haven't touched and personalize the layout. Before my blog posts are blog posts, I'm organizing them (and all my notes for this course) in a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) page. Notion lets you share your own personal pages as webpages, so I'm sharing all of my notes for this course!! You can see all my notes here: [https://www.notion.so/sdaitzman/Impossible-Maps-0a44004cdf5c4e3994e5b1b778c84c15](https://www.notion.so/sdaitzman/Impossible-Maps-0a44004cdf5c4e3994e5b1b778c84c15). The blog ([https://sdaitzman.github.io/impossible-maps-blog/](https://sdaitzman.github.io/impossible-maps-blog/)) will have slightly more-edited posts, and the Notion page will have in-process notes. If you open a Notion page while I'm working on it, you'll see live updates. Notion supports direct Markdown export, so there's no manual markdown conversion involved.

# [Anatomy of a Web Map](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map)

I love thinking of web maps (and systems, generally) as living things with many parts and connections. After reading through the presentation, I spent a long time looking through [Stamen's website](https://stamen.com) to see what thinking of a map as a living thing leads to. I really loved three projects in particular:

- [Penny](https://stamen.com/work/penny/) is an AI model that predicts wealth based on satellite imagery. The researchers then tried tweaking areas to make them look "more expensive" or "less expensive" and found that the model picked up on these changes.
- [Facebook Flowers](https://stamen.com/work/facebook-flowers/) generates data-visualization flowers of popular memes on Facebook.
- [Open Earth](https://stamen.com/work/open-earth/) seems to be a map composed of localized news stories.

# On Exactitudes in Science (Borges)

(Translated by Andrew Hurley).

This brief story creates an image of a true 1:1 map, and emphasizes its downfall through narrative and imagery: "that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters." An important premise is that maps *will* become inaccurate or outdated, or even lose information, without being maintained. I wonder if this is still true of digital, web maps, and whether digital maps can do some of this maintenance work themselves.

# Excerpt from The Precession of Simulacra (Baudrillard)

Baudrillard argues that at this point, humanity's maps and models create new realities that replace base reality. I'm interested in what hyperrealities Baudrillard is talking about. This reading made me think about borders and nations. People talk about strict national boundaries as natural and immovable features of reality, but they can't exist without that self-reinforcing active belief in them.

# Experimental Geography (Paglen)

My interpretation of the core thesis of this essay is that geographic space is a fluid, perpetual action â€” not a static pattern. The social significance of a particular area is lost without the context of the human actions that create, manage, defend, attack or otherwise interact with that space. Under this model, relations matter and any map of a space produces a particular version of that space. There are no perfect 1:1 representations of a space.
